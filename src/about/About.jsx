          Gluten Free Finds was created with the goal of helping the gluten-free community
          work together to have an increased variety of food options.

          Gluten-free foods often are far inferior to their gluten counterparts, but not always!
          When you find a gluten-free item that impresses you, submit it so the gluten-free community
          can share in your delight!
